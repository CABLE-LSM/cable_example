# This configuration file is optional. If this file is present, the model
# driver updates the met forcing paths in the namelist file to point to the
# correct met forcing for the current simulation year.

# offset: [<from>, <to>]
# Offset the current simulation year from year <from> to year <to> before
# updating the met forcing paths.
# This key is optional.

# repeat: [<from>, <to>]
# Constrain the current simulation year between years <from> to <to>
# (inclusive) before updating the met forcing paths. When the current
# simulation year is outside the range specified, the forcing is repeated over
# the specified range.
# This key is optional.
